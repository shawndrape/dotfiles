# Dotfiles

## Dependencies

Install Homebrew, and be sure to add the eval script to .zprofile (which this does not manage)

## Reminders

* `.gitconfig` - Unless brew is installing apps automatically during 
a setup, be sure to have installed the GitHub CLI app and done the ssh
auth. Otherwise, connection will not work
